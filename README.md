# Portfolio website
Here is a mockup of my portfolio website layout as it would appear on its hosting site.
'index.html' represents the landing page, 'skills.html' representing the page displaying my skillset, 
and 'portfolio.html' is the page that showcases a few of my recent projects (Apple, Adobe, Lyft, and LLS). 
I used AJAX to load content under the nav to create a fluid user experience.
